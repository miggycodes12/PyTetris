Controls:
W - Rotate piece
A - Move piece left
S - Force piece to fall faster
D - Move piece right

Bugs I found during testing (v0.8):
- When clearing a row, the pieces might not fully fall down and may leave a row of empty tiles.
- Colors of tiles may change when clearing rows. (rare)
- Pieces may dissapear when rotating. (rare)

NEW NOTE FROM miggycodes12 (5/22/2025)
Hello! Im here to say that this project is discontinued. Yes, I know the code is quite the mess but it was honestly a great experience for me.
Everything was programmed in about a week I'd say and was entirely programmed by me with zero assistance. No tutorials or AI. This was my final project
for Python and I stopped programming for a while ever since I published the source code on my github. Version 1.0 will not come but the current bugs so far
lack the impact to make the game unenjoyable but they do occur very rarely. I've now moved on to C++ and started new big projects that I'm working on by myself.
That's all from me and enjoy this passion project of mine!
