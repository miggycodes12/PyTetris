Controls:
W - Rotate piece
A - Move piece left
S - Force piece to fall faster
D - Move piece right

Bugs I found during testing (v0.8):
- When clearing a row, the pieces might not fully fall down and may leave a row of empty tiles.
- Colors of tiles may change when clearing rows. (rare)
- Pieces may dissapear when rotating. (rare)
