Controls:
W - Rotate piece
A - Move piece left
S - Force piece to fall faster
D - Move piece right

Bugs I found during testing (v0.8):
Major:
- When clearing a row, the pieces might not fully fall down and may leave a row of empty tiles.
Minor (rare bugs):
- Colors of tiles may change when clearing rows.
- Pieces may dissapear when rotating.
